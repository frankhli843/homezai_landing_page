/*
 * What the editor's Preview pane shows.
 *
 * Pure: no window, no stylesheet, no editor. preview.js is the part that wires this
 * into Sveltia, so everything below can be exercised directly by the test suite.
 *
 * Sveltia's own preview is a labelled dump of every field: Internal id, Web address,
 * Home page order, Previous web addresses, and so on. That is a view of the form, not
 * a view of the article, and a publisher deciding whether something is ready to go out
 * cannot use it to answer the only question that matters, which is what the reader
 * will see. This module replaces it with the real thing.
 *
 * Two properties are deliberate.
 *
 * The body is rendered by src/content/markdown.js, the exact renderer the published
 * page uses, not by a second one that happens to look similar. If the two differed the
 * preview would be able to lie in the one direction that matters most: raw HTML pasted
 * into the body renders as inert text on the live site, and a preview using a
 * different renderer could show it executing, or show it rendering, and either way
 * would teach the publisher something untrue.
 *
 * The stylesheet is src/App.css itself, imported as text and handed to Sveltia as a
 * raw style, rather than a hand copied subset. A copy drifts the first time somebody
 * changes the real article styles, and a preview that drifts is worse than no preview
 * because it is believed.
 *
 * Everything here degrades. Sveltia gives the preview component a React element
 * factory only indirectly, so the element is built from the shape of a real one; if
 * that ever stops working, or a field is missing, or the hero has not been uploaded
 * yet, the preview says so in place rather than throwing and leaving an empty pane.
