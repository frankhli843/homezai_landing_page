      // has reached an approved source. An honest text wordmark is the correct
      // card until it does; borrowing a logo off the web would put a third
      // party's mark on our marketing site with no licence to use it.

      // The card says the organization and where it operates, and deliberately
      // claims nothing about what may be DISPLAYED from the feed. Homezai has
      // verified technical access to SDMLS; no consumer-facing display (IDX)
      // authorization has been read for it, and the other cards on this page
      // carry the same open question, so this page has never made that claim.
