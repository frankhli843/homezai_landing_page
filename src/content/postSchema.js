 * percent escapes, and a character whitelist rejected those with the words "never a
 * remote or hotlinked url" for a file that was neither.
 *
 * What must never pass is a second path segment or an address that leaves the site, so
 * a slash, a backslash, a query, a fragment, a quote, an angle bracket, a backtick, a
 * control character, a leading space and the bare "." and ".." are all refused, and the
 * string has to start with the prefix. The quotes and brackets are not what makes the
 * rule correct; they are refused because no real file name needs them either.
 *
 * Nothing downstream builds a filesystem path out of this value. The publish step
 * matches it against the uploads it indexed and writes under the name IT derived, so a
