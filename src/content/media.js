/*
 * Media validation.
 *
 * Everything about an upload except its bytes is attacker controlled: the file name,
 * the extension and any content type a client claims. So type is decided by the leading
 * bytes and nothing else, and the answer is checked against a whitelist rather than a
 * blacklist.
 *
 * SVG is excluded on purpose even though it is an image. An SVG is an XML document that
 * can carry script and external references, and it would be served from the site's own
 * origin, so an accepted SVG is stored cross site scripting.
 *
 * Metadata stripping and resizing happen in mediaPipeline.js, which needs a native
 * image library. This module stays dependency free so that the rules can be tested
 * anywhere.
